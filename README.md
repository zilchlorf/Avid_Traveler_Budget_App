# Project_Description:
The project exhibits offline functionality.  The user is able to add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without a connection.  When entering transactions offline, the total is populated when brought back online. 

# Usage:
 Good for use by avid travelers who don't always have an internet connection, but still want to maintain a database that will be updated once they are back online. 

# Installation:
 Simply navigate to the deployed application at avid-traveler-budget-app.herokuapp.com 

# Contribute:
 Feel free to fork, clone and play with the code. 

# tests
How to test project functionality: Try using the app in an area where there is no internet connection and then return to a connection and see if the data that you entered while offline populates.
